# What is Post Modernism?

**Post Modernism** is a literary, cultural, and philosophical movement that emerged in the mid-20th century, characterized by:

- **Skepticism toward grand narratives:** challenges universal truths and absolute ideologies.
- **Fragmentation:** Celebrates discontinuity and multiple perspectives in texts
- **Absurdity:** Use of absurb elements to show skepticism towards conventions

# Examples of Postmodernism

Postmodernism spans various media. Ex:

### **Literature**
- **"Kew Gardens" by Virginia Woolf**  
  A modernist short story that used postmodern devices like stream of consciousness and fragmentation.

### **Art**
- **Andy Warhol’s *Campbell’s Soup Cans***  
  Blurs the line between high art and consumer culture, embracing irony and repetition.

### **Film**
- **"Pulp Fiction" (1994)**  
  Directed by Quentin Tarantino, it employs non-linear storytelling, self-referential humor, and pastiche.

# Comedian
Maurezio Cattelan, 2019

**The Comedian** is a highly post-modern artwork. It featured a banana duct-taped to a wall, questioning the role of consumerism, celebrity, and context in the art world. By using everyday objects, he underscored post-modernism's tendency to blend high-end and low-end cultures.
